My Research Project is to attempt to create a Online Multiselect algorithm that can select enough elements to sort the array in a faster time than actually sorting the array with another algorithm (Quicksort, Mergesort, etc.). This involves elevating quickselect, and adding a bitvector array (V) to mark what elements in the correct position (0 for not in-position, and 1 for in-position). Later, this algorithm will integrate a not-yet-coded partitioning scheme by German professor Kanela Kaligosi.
